## Project Objective  

This project aims to help Food Engineering students understand the concept of open-source collaboration through GitHub.  
It allows students to share short scientific notes about food science, nutrition, and food safety in an open and collaborative way.

The main objectives are:  
- Discover how GitHub works.  
- Learn how to share scientific information.  
- Develop teamwork and collaboration skills.  
- Create a small collective project on a scientific theme.  

---

## Steps to Achieve the Project  

### Step 1: Define the Objective  
- Understand the concept of open-source collaboration on GitHub.  
- Set a clear purpose: create a collaborative repository containing short topics related to food science.  

---

### Step 2: Create the GitHub Repository  
- Create a repository named **TP-01** or **Open-Source-Food-Knowledge**.  
- Add a **README.md** file that includes:  
  - Project name  
  - Membersâ€™ names  
  - Department or class  
  - Objectives and project description  

---

### Step 3: Organize the Project Structure
- Create a clear and organized folder structure.  
- Each student should have a folder or a `.md` file for their topic.  
- Example structure
- This structure ensures that all topics are easy to find, edit, and collaborate on.
### Step 4: Write Individual Contributions  
Each student writes a short Markdown file (`.md`) about a topic related to food science.  

Examples of possible topics:  
- Food preservation methods  
- Food safety and hygiene  
- Basics of nutrition  
- Food microbiology  
- Food processing and technology  

Each file should follow this structure:  

```markdown
# Title of the topic  
## Introduction  
Brief introduction to the topic.  

## Main Points  
- Point 1: short explanation.  
- Point 2: short explanation.  
- Point 3: short explanation.  

## Conclusion  
Short summary of the key ideas.

### Step 5: Add Content to GitHub  
1. Create a file inside the `topics/` folder.  
2. Paste your content in Markdown format.  
3. Click **Commit changes** to save it on GitHub.  

---

### Step 6: Collaborate with the Team  
- Invite teammates as **collaborators**.  
- Each member adds or edits their own file.  
- Use **Pull Requests** to review and approve changes.  

---

### Step 7: Add License and Contribution Guide  
- Add a **LICENSE** file (for example, MIT License).  
- Add a **CONTRIBUTING.md** file explaining how to contribute to the project.  

---

### Step 8: Review and Validation  
- The teacher or project supervisor reviews each contribution.  
- Use the **Contributors** or **Commits** section to track who contributed.  

---

### Step 9: Finalize the Project  
- Check that all topic files are correctly added and formatted.  
- Review the content for clarity and accuracy.  
- The repository then becomes an open-source educational resource.

## Expected Results  

By completing this project, students will:  
- Learn how GitHub works.  
- Develop collaboration and teamwork skills.  
- Learn how to write and share scientific content.  
- Understand the fundamentals of food science and nutrition.
