### Project Objective

This project aims to help food engineering students understand the concept of open-source collaboration through GitHub.  
It allows students to share short scientific notes about food science, nutrition, and food safety in an open and collaborative way.

The main objectives are:
- Discover how GitHub works.
- Learn how to share scientific information.
- Develop teamwork and collaboration skills.
- Create a small collective project on a scientific topic.

### About the Project

The **Open Source Food Knowledge** project is a simple GitHub project created by beginner students.  
The idea is not to write code, but to understand how open-source platforms like GitHub can help organize and share scientific information.

Each student contributes a short topic related to food science, for example:
- Food preservation methods
- Food safety and hygiene
- Basics of nutrition
- Food technology and processing
- Food microbiology

Each topic is written as a Markdown file (`.md`) and added to the GitHub repository under the `topics/` folder.

### How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository or clone it if you have write access.  
2. Create a new file inside the `topics/` folder named with the topic (for example `my-topic.md`).  
3. Write your contribution in English (and optionally Arabic) using Markdown.  
4. Commit your change and push to your branch.  
5. Open a pull request with a short description of your contribution.

### Example structure
Here is an example of how to organize your contribution inside the repository:

Each `.md` file should follow this simple format:

```markdown
# Title of the topic

## Introduction
Brief introduction to the topic.

## Main Points
- Point 1: short explanation.
- Point 2: short explanation.
- Point 3: short explanation.

## Conclusion
Short summary of the key ideas.
