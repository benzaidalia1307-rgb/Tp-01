## Project Goal  
This project aims to help food engineering students understand the idea of Open Source collaboration using GitHub.  
It allows students to share short scientific notes about food science, nutrition, and food safety in an open and collaborative way.

## About the Project  
Open Source Food Knowledge is a simple GitHub project created by students who are new to programming.  
The goal is not to write code, but to understand how open-source platforms like GitHub can help students share and organize information together.  

Each student contributes one small topic related to food science, such as:
- Food preservation methods  
- Food safety and hygiene  
- Nutrition basics  
- Food technology and processing  
- Microbiology in food
